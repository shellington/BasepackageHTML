				<h1>Yeoman Generator</h1>
				<p>We have a yeoman generator set up called 'generator-ph'</p>
				<p>Currently it is set to install a base package of files to start a site build from. The following are pulled in:</p>

				<h3>Steps to install our generator-ph</h3>
				<p>...</p>
				
				<h3>To run generator-ph when starting a build:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Create your build folder locally e.g. buildname_html</li>
					<li>Using cmd change into this directory</li>
					<li>enter 'yo ph' and follow the steps as prompted</li>
					<li>Important: The html files are all pulled from our BasepackageHTML git repo. When running the generator you must ensure the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/PhCreative/BasepackageHTML">BasepackageHTML repo</a> is set to public so the files can be accessed (the generator prompts you to do this before it begins). You can then set the repo back to pivate once finished.</li>
					<li>Important: Once you have your local base package you will need to do a quick find and replace for: '/BasepackageHTML/'. Just delete this from all paths in your html and app.js files. This part of the path is needed for the gh-pages branch in our repo to display in the browser, can't see a way around it unfortunately.</li>
					<li>Finally you're good to go. Just make sure cmd is pointing to your local build folder, run 'grunt' and start building!</li>
				</ul>
				

				<h3>Steps to update our ph generator</h3>
				<p>To work on the generator-ph you will need to clone it from our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/PhCreative/generator-ph">generator-ph</a> repo to your machine locally.</p>
				<p>While workiong locally to run the generator and check what it is doing based on your edits do the following: (<a target="_blank" href="http://elegantcode.com/2011/12/16/taking-baby-steps-with-node-js-linking-local-packages-with-npm/">source artice</a>)</p>
				<ul>
					<li>using cmd cd into your generator-ph local clone and enter 'npm link'</li>
					<li>go to your local 'test folder' that you want to run the generator on and enter 'npm link generator-ph'</li>
					<li>then run 'yo ph' on the test folder</li>
					<li>Important: remember to unlink both folders after you've finished testing ('npm unlink' and 'npm unlink generator-ph' in the respective folders as outlined above).</li>
				</ul>
				<p>When ready commit your edits back up to the generator-ph repo once finished (<a href="/BasepackageHTML/guides/github.html">see the guide to using git</a>)</p>
				<p>Finally to publish these changes to the actual ph-generator you need to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Change the version number in generator-ph/package.json</li>
					<li>using cmd change directory to your local clone of the generator-ph and enter 'npm publish'*</li>
					<li><small>*you do need to have publishing permissions for this command to work. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/">Sign up for an account</a> and then Michelle or Heather can add you - just tell them the email address you used for signing up.</small></li>
					<li>Once published you will need to open cmd and run 'npm install -g generator-ph' - <strong>Important: make sure to notify the team as they will all need to do this step too in order to get your updates!</strong></li>
				</ul>
